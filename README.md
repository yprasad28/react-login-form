# ðŸŒŸ Day 15: Building a React Login Form ðŸŒŸ



Today, I took a big step in my React journey by building a functional login form component. Here's what I accomplished:



1. **State Management:**

  - Utilized the `useState` hook to manage the state for username and password inputs.

  - Leveraged controlled components to handle user input and update state accordingly.



2. **Handling User Inputs:**

  - Created functions `enterUser` and `enterPassword` to handle changes in the username and password fields.

  - Captured user input and updated the state in real-time.



3. **User Authentication Logic:**

  - Defined user credentials within the component for simplicity.

  - Implemented a `loginClicked` function to validate the entered username and password.

  - Displayed appropriate alerts for successful and failed login attempts.





4. **Styling and Layout:**

  - Designed a simple yet effective user interface with a login card, input fields, and a login button.

  - Added an image and a "Forget Password?" link for a complete login experience.
