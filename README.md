ðŸš€ Day 17 & 18: Creating a Secure Login Form with JWT Authentication! ðŸŒŸ

Over the past couple of days, I worked on creating a login form with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Implementing JWT authentication ensures secure user sessions and enhances overall application security.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Login Form: Developed an intuitive and user-friendly login form.

JWT Authentication: Integrated JWT authentication for secure access.

Token Storage: Stored the JWT token in both localStorage for persistent storage and sessionStorage for temporary session-based storage.

Smooth User Experience: Ensured a seamless user experience with robust security measures.
